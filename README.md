## Formula 1 Seasons Dataset (2020â€“2025)

This project aims to build a comprehensive dataset covering Formula 1 seasons from 2020 to 2025. The goal is to demonstrate my skills in data engineering, including data collection, cleaning, integration, and structuring for analysis.

**Note:** I did not use Beautiful Soup for web scraping because the target web service does not render tables using standard HTML. Instead, I explored alternative methods to extract the data, such as API requests, browser automation, and manual parsing of dynamic content.

The final dataset includes race results, practice sessions, qualifying data, and driver/team performance metrics across multiple seasons. It is designed to support analytical tasks such as performance comparison, consistency tracking, and predictive modeling.
